            <h1>All About Me</h1>

            <p>Hi there! I'm Sarah Mohamed, and I'm on a journey to explore various aspects of life and express my
                creativity in different forms.</p>

            <p>On the weekends, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with new recipes and creating dishes.
                Cooking has become more than just a hobby; it's a way for me to express my creativity and share joy with
                friends and family.</p>

            <p>Family is at the core of my values. Spending quality time with loved ones is something I cherish the
                most.
                Whether it's a cozy evening at home, celebrating special occasions, or embarking on exciting adventures
                together, the bond with my family is irreplaceable.</p>

            <p>Good times are best enjoyed with friends, and I'm fortunate to have a wonderful circle of friends who
                share
                my passions. We love exploring new cafes, experimenting with art, and having deep conversations about
                life
                and the future.</p>

            <p>I also have a profound love for flowers; they make me happy and are aesthetically pleasing. Their beauty
                adds
                a special touch to my life, and I often find inspiration in their colors and shapes.</p>

            <p>If you're curious about my journey in the world of software development, art, cooking, or travel, feel
                free
                to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahmohamed100"
                    target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
                I'm excited to share my experiences and connect with like-minded individuals. I've been actively working
                on
                various projects that showcase my skills and interests. You can check out some of my projects on GitHub:
